# 3D-Face-Reconstruction
Project Description:
This project aims to bridge the gap between AI and 3D modeling by developing an AI-powered system that reconstructs realistic 3D face models from a single 2D image using deep learning techniques. Unlike traditional photogrammetry, which requires multiple images from different angles, this system leverages neural networks to infer 3D geometry from a single frontal image.

Users will upload a 2D image via a web interface, and the model will generate a 3D mesh in real time. The reconstructed face will be displayed interactively using Three.js, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and explore the 3D output. The generated .obj files can also be exported for 3D printing or further modifications.

The system will utilize EG3D or DECA (pretrained models for face reconstruction) to extract depth and facial structure details. While these models are already trained on large datasets like FFHQ, they can be fine-tuned on custom datasets if higher accuracy or domain-specific modifications are required. The backend will be powered by Python (Flask/FastAPI), while the frontend will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js for 3D visualization.
